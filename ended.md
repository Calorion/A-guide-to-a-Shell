# Ended?

Of course not!

As you can see, many parts are not finished yet! This doc is still in progress and everyone is welcomed to have everything completed, fix errors or share ideas. See [contribute-to-the-book.md](contribute-to-the-book.md "mention") for more information.

### Our current works

* Have [submit-new-packages.md](lets-do-more-for-it/submit-new-packages.md "mention") finished. The `install.sh` should be polished currently.
* Finish the progress of compiling native codes. A Mac is needed!
* Seek for an experienced guy to finish [run-jupyter.md](basic-tutorials/run-jupyter.md "mention").
* Try to talk about the ecosystem of WebAssembly clearly.
* Research on `node.js`, `bun` and `jsc`. Find a way to import JavaScript modules conveniently.
