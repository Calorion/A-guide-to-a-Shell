# A-Shell’s differences

In this article, we will talk about three topics: a-Shell’s features, limitations, and comparison with alternatives.

### Features

#### Shortcuts

This is one of the most welcomed functions of a-Shell. You can easily find the supported shortcuts on WorkFlow:

With WorkFlow, what you can do with a shell has been greatly expanded.

By default, all files generated by shortcuts are stored at `~shortcuts/`.

#### Jump here and there

`z` command is built-in. With it you can easily jump between dictionaries. What’s more, `z` is lighter and faster than `autojump`,  making it more suitable for a-Shell.

Adding bookmarks for dictionaries is also supported. Use `bookmark <name>` to add a bookmark for the current dictionary, `cd ~<name>` or `jump <name>` to jump to a bookmark, `showmarks` to show all current bookmarks, `renamemark` to revise the name of a bookmark and `deletemark` to delete it.

Any time you run `cd` without a parameter, you will be led to `~/Documents`, the initial dictionary. `cd -` will lead you to the last dictionary you were.

#### iOS/iPadOS interactions

A series of commands are provided to interact with other apps. Use `open <file>` to share a file to other apps:

Use `view` to view a file rapidly, which may be helpful for PDF/HTML files or images.

Use `play` command to play audio/video files.

Although you can easily share a file from a-Shell by `open`, you can’t share a file to a-Shell directly. Fortunately, you can achieve that using shortcuts. As mentioned earlier, all files shared to a-Shell are saved at `~shortcuts/`. For another location, consider using a shortcut to execute a command automatically.

#### Access to the files

With `pickFolder` command, a-Shell can get access to another location on your iPhone/iPad, iCloud for example.

You can also read/write `~/Documents/` folder with Files. Switch to “My iPhone”/“My iPad”, and you’ll see the dictionary “a-Shell”. Attention files outside of `~/Documents/` can not be read.

### Limitations

Limitations mainly come from two aspects: those from Apple and those from the FSF.

#### Limitations from Apple

Due to Apple’s limitation, only those dictionaries can be accessed by a-Shell: `~/Documents/`, `~/Library` and `~/tmp`, which has made a-Shell’s file structure uncommon. All user configuration files are stored at `~/Documents/` instead of `~`, and `$HOME` has been set to `~/Documents/` as well.&#x20;
